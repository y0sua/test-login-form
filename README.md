## Getting Started

### Mockup

[Get a mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/RkOUnhCQ4fydOnRzuXd6SW/Test-Task?node-id=514%3A6). If you don't have access, please write an email to dev@24slides.com.

### Form concept

Validation schema:
 - `Email` is required and has to be matched with email validation rules;
 - `Password` is required;
 - `Remember me` checkbox is `boolean` value.

The validation errors have to be displayed after submit button is pressed and then a focused field has to be revalidated on every input change.

"Sign up", Google and Microsoft providers, "Forgot Password?" are custom buttons. No need to handle any of their actions but keep designed styles.

### Requirements

- The required stack: `React`, `SCSS`. Other tools are up to you;
- Create a markup according to the mockup, the layout should be responsive until `320x568` screen resolution;
- No unnecessary things in the final code like commented code, debug logs, etc.

Follow best practices as much as possible, focus on the quality and accuracy of the task.

Please, provide a repository link when the task is ready.
